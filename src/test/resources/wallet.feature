Feature: Wallet API
  As a fintech developer
  I want to test the Wallet API
  So that I can ensure it is working correctly

Scenario: Create wallet
  Given a wallet with name "My Wallet" and balance 100
  When I POST the wallet to the "/wallets" endpoint
  Then the response status should be 201
  And the response body should contain the wallet

Scenario: Get wallet
  Given a wallet with ID 1 and name "My Wallet" and balance 100
  When I GET the wallet from the "/wallets/1" endpoint
  Then the response status should be 200
  And the response body should contain the wallet

Scenario: Update wallet
  Given a wallet with ID 1 and name "My Wallet" and balance 100
  When I PUT the wallet to the "/wallets/1" endpoint with name "Updated Wallet" and balance 200
  Then the response status should be 200
  And the response body should contain the updated wallet

Scenario: Delete wallet
  Given a wallet with ID 1 and name "My Wallet" and balance 100
  When I DELETE the wallet from the "/wallets/1" endpoint
  Then the response status should be 204
  And the wallet should not be retrievable
